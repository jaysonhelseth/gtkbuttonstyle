# gtkbuttonstyle
A prototype GTK 3 program for styling buttons.

This python prototype will show how to add color and some other styling to gtk buttons. I found these tips scattered around the web and put them together in a repo so I had a place to look it up. I also put it out so that others can find something useful here too.

The css file will have the style properties for each button listed in the GUI.
